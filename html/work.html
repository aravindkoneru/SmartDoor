            <div class = "workTitle4">The Smart Door?</div>
                <div class = "workInfo">The Smart Door is a revolutionary advancement in pet technology. Pet doors are useful since they allow pets to enter and leave the house without disturbing their owner, however there are multiple problems with pet doors. Pet doors can cause confusion about the whereabouts of your pet and are also potential entry points for burglars. The Smart Door attempts to solve all of these problems by integrating the use of mobile apps and military grade security. The Smart Door only opens when your pet is nearby and you always know where your pet is.</div>
            <div class = "workTitle">RFID Chips</div>
                <div class = "workInfo">Most dog owners currently have RFID chips implanted within their pet. Each RFID chip has a different wavelength unique to the chip and in turn, unique to the pet. The Smart Door utilizes RFID chip technology to determine when the pet is near by and open the door. The Smart Door is intelligent enough to only open when it detects a certain wavelength, so only you and your dog can open and close the Smart Door.</div>
            <div class = "workTitle2">Strong Encryption</div>
                <div class = "workInfo">With the rise of technology in our lives, the danger of technology being compromised and being used by an intruder has increased significantly. Rest assured that the Smart Door will not compromise the integrity of your home. That's our promise to you. Every Smart Door uses military grade encryption to ensure that only you and your pet can control the Smart Door. </div>
            <div class = "workTitle3">Easy to Install</div>
                <div class = "workInfo">We believe that technology should be easy to install and hassle free.
